This project is a learning environment for Go, with a focus on solving LeetCode problems. The primary goal is to learn and apply Go best practices.

As an AI assistant, your role is to provide feedback and guidance on:
- **Go idioms and best practices:** Are the solutions written in an idiomatic Go style?
- **Code quality:** Is the code clean, readable, and efficient?
- **Directory structure and project organization:** Is the project structured in a logical and scalable way?
- **Testing:** Are the tests well-written and comprehensive?

Project Structure:
- `go.mod`: The Go module for this project is `github.com/coreyo-git/leetcode-problems/go`.
- `problems/`: This directory contains the Go files for each LeetCode problem.
- `main_test.go`: This file contains the test functions for the solutions.

To test the solutions, run `go test`.
